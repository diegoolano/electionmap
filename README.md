electionmap
===========

2012 US election county and socio-economic data visualization.
Based on the idea that Austin is a blue island in a sea of red politically speaking,
I wanted to find similar counties in the states.  I then wanted to try and explain
why these counties are blue so I added socio-economic data from measureofamerica.org.
Future work will go towards prediction/classification and adding public health data
and writing something short on the process and findings.
